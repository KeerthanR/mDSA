  \begin{abstract}
  Deterministic Suffix-reading Automata (DSA) were introduced recently as a  concise model for regular languages. 
  DSAs can succinctly capture formal specifications that are based on \emph{sequences} of input actions (and not just single actions). For a distributed system, specifications may further depend on combinations of input sequences seen across multiple components (ports). 
  For such systems, DSAs consider all possible interleavings, resulting in large and unreadable automata.

  In this work, we enrich DSAs to include a $\parallel$ operator in its transitions. The resulting \emph{multi-port DSAs (mDSAs)} can succinctly represent concurrent suffix-based specifications. We provide a formal operational semantics for mDSAs and prove that emptiness for mDSAs is PSPACE-complete. 
  Then, we apply our results to the analysis of Expressive Decision Tables (EDTs) -- an industry notation for specifying requirements of reactive systems. The EDT notation has been successfully deployed in various industrial settings. However, arguably, due to a complex interplay between concurrency and suffix-based conditions, the notation lacks a rigorous operational semantics. As a result, existing test generation algorithms for EDTs do not give any theoretical guarantees. Here, we provide formal operational semantics for a fragment of the EDT notation using mDSAs, and reduce EDT-test-generation to mDSA-emptiness.
