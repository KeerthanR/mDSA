\section{Conclusion}

We have presented mDSA-with-outputs, an extension of DSA with concurrency and outputs. The resulting model captures suffix-based specifications of concurrent systems more succinctly compared to a DSA or a DFA. We have illustrated this idea over several examples. The main challenge was to provide a clean operational semantics that can account for suffixes, multiple ports and outputs. We have applied our study to the formal analysis of a fragment of Expressive Decision Tables (EDT), an industry notation for formal specifications. Although there are several automaton based models known in the literature, we believe mDSA-with-outputs gives a fresh perspective on \emph{suffix-based} specifications in the presence of concurrency and outputs. Extending this work to the real-time setting is an interesting direction for future work.
