abstract = {We propose an extension of the Finite State Machine framework in distributed systems, using input/output partial order automata (IOPOA). In this model, transitions can be executed non-atomically, reacting to asynchronous inputs on several ports, and producing asynchronous output on those ports. We develop the formal framework for distributed testing in this architecture and compare with the synchronous I/O automaton setting. The advantage of the compact modelling by IOPOA combines with low complexity : the number of tests required for concurrent input in our model is polynomial in the number of inputs.},
