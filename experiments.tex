We have implemented a prototype test generator for EDTs using the translation of EDTs to mDSA-with-outputs \cite{mDSAcode}. In our implementation, we translate the given EDT $\Tt$ into an mDSA-with-outputs $\Bb^\Tt$ and simulate the semantics of $\Bb^\Tt$ using the finite transition system $\Ssf^{\Bb^\Tt}$ described in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:complexity}.

First we look at a couple of small EDTs. Suppose we want a testcase for Row 1 in Table~\ref{tab:edt-alarm}. Encoding this in our tool gives a testcase ($P; P$) for Row 1, when default values for $I$ and $A$ are set to $F$.
Next we look at Table~\ref{tab:wiper}, a partial representation of a wiper module in a car. The tool finds a testcase (park;notpark) for Row 2.

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c||c|c|}
    \hline
    sno & \specialcell{in \\ ignition} &
                                         \specialcell{in \\ wiperswitch} & 
                                                                       \specialcell{in 
    \\ parksensor} & \specialcell{in \\ error} & \specialcell{out \\ wipercmd} & 
                                             \specialcell{out \\ error} \\
    \hline 
    1 & on & on & 
    & false & wipe &
    \\
    \hline

    2 & & & (park;notpark) & & dontwipe & true \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  
\end{table}


We now present an EDT for which our tool can solve the test generation problem, whereas randomized techniques will have low success probability. 
The EDT is a slight variation of the $N$ bit counter presented in Section~\ref{sec:mdsao-synt}. We depict a part of the EDT for three bits in
Table \ref{tab:binary}. 
In addition we add a row to check for all $t_i = 1$ , and also have an extra letter in the port $T$. Therefore there is exactly one sequence that makes all the $t_i$ equal to $1$. Randomized techniques have a low probability of generating such a test case. 
Our prototype implementation generates a test case for $N=5$.

Our goal with the experiments was not to present a scalable tool for EDT test generation. We aimed to create an open source simulator for mDSA-with-outputs, which we have applied on EDT test case generation. As future work, we plan to investigate scalable algorithms for reachability in mDSA-with-outputs.
