\section{Multiport DSAs with outputs}
\label{sec:multiport-outputs}

In Section~\ref{sec:multiport}, we have seen multi-port DSAs which process inputs across several ports and match transitions. In many situations, requirements also talk about outputting values to certain ports when transitions match. Here is an example of some requirements of a \emph{Car Alarm module}, adapted from~\cite{DBLP:conf/enase/VenkateshSZA15a}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the most recent values on \emph{Ignition} ($I$) and \emph{Alarm} ($A$) are \texttt{Off}, and the last two values on the Panic Switch ($P$) are \texttt{Press;Press}, then the value \texttt{On} is output on the port \emph{Alarm}.

\item If the last three values on the Panic Switch are \texttt{Release;Release;Release}, and the Alarm is \texttt{On}, then output \texttt{False} on \emph{Flash} ($F$)
and \emph{Alarm}.

\item If last value on \emph{Ignition} is \texttt{On}, then \texttt{False} is output on \emph{Flash} and \texttt{Off} is output on \emph{Alarm}.
\end{enumerate}

The first requirement checks for $I:\mathtt{Off} \parallel A:\mathtt{Off} \parallel P:\mathtt{Press;Press}$ and immediately writes $A: \mathtt{On}$. The check-and-update is a fully atomic operation. One way to model this requirement as an mDSA would be to absorb port $A$ as part of the state: that is the state of the mDSA is defined using values of such ports that are used both for inputs and outputs. However, this would lead to an exponential blowup in the number of states when there are multiple such ports that are both read and written on transitions. To succinctly capture requirements with outputs, we allow both reads and writes on all ports and define \emph{mDSAs with outputs}. Later, in Section~\ref{sec:edt} we will use these mDSAs-with-outputs to give a semantics for the industry notation Expressive Decision Tables (EDTs).

\subsection{mDSA-with-outputs: formal syntax and semantics}
\label{sec:mdsao-synt}
The syntax of mDSA-with-outputs is almost the same as that of mDSAs. The only difference is in the syntax of transitions.  As before, there is a multiport alphabet $\Sigma = \langle \Sigma_1, \dots, \Sigma_k \rangle$. An mDSA-with-outputs $\Bb$ is a tuple $(Q, \Sigma, q_0, \delta)$ where $Q$ is a finite set of states, $q_0$ is the initial state and $\delta$ is a finite set of transitions. We do not view these automata as language acceptors, and so we do not specifically define accept states. We will instead discuss  state reachability. 

\paragraph*{Transitions.} A transition now looks like:
\begin{align*}
q \xra[~~O_1: b_1 ~\parallel~ O_2: b_2 ~\parallel~ \cdots ~\parallel~ O_m: b_m~~]{I_1: u_1 ~\parallel~ I_2: u_2 ~\parallel~ \cdots ~\parallel~ I_\ell: u_\ell} q'
\end{align*}
where $q, q'$ are states; each $u_j$ is a word in the port alphabet of $I_j$; and each $b_j$ is a letter in the port alphabet of $O_j$. We remark that $\{I_1, \dots, I_k\} \cap \{O_1, \dots, O_m\}$ may be non-empty. In other words, some of the ports may appear both as input and output in a transition.  

\paragraph*{Semantics.} Configurations of $\Bb$ are the same as before, given by $(q, w, \theta)$ with $q$ a state, $w$ the word seen so far and $\theta$ a position of the tape head. The semantics is a transition system $\Ss^\Bb = (S, s_0, \xra{})$ where $S$ is the set of configurations, with $s_0$ being the initial configuration $(q_0, \epsilon, 0)$. Let $\rho = (q, (I_1: u_1 \parallel \cdots I_\ell:u_\ell), (O_1: b_1 \parallel \cdots \parallel O_m: b_m), q')$. There are three kinds of transitions in $\Ss^\Bb$:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{$\epsilon$-transitions.} $(q, w, \theta) \xra[\rho]{~~\epsilon~~} (q', wb_1 b_2 \dots b_m, |w|)$ if the input condition ($I_1:u_1 \parallel \cdots \parallel I_\ell:u_\ell$) matches the tape configuration $(w, \theta)$; in that case move the tape head to the end of $w$ and write all the outputs to the right of $w$ (order of writing does not matter).
\item \emph{transitions on input letters.} if no outgoing transition from $q$ has a label that  matches the current tape configuration $(w, \theta)$, then there is no $\epsilon$ transition out of $(q, w, \theta)$ and the mDSA-with-outputs listens to further input letters: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $(q, w, \theta) \xra[\rho]{~~a~~} (q', wab_1 b_2 \dots b_m, |wa|)$ if $I_1:u_1 \parallel \cdots \parallel I_\ell:u_\ell$ matches $(wa, \theta)$; then, move the tape head to the end of $wa$ and write the outputs after that,
\item $(q, w, \theta) \xra{~~a~~} (q, wa, \theta)$ if no transition out of $q$ matches $(wa, \theta)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize} 
Notice that the transitions on input letters have the same matching semantics as in an mDSA, except now they also write all the outputs to the end of the word. The main change is the presence of $\epsilon$-transitions. Since we write outputs after matching a transition, on reaching a new state $q'$ there could already be transitions out of $q'$ that match the current tape. Previously, in mDSA, this would not happen, since the tape head would be at the end of the word, and at least one port should see a fully fresh match. 

Surprisingly, this ability to produce outputs which can in turn be consumed by input conditions, creates complex behaviours.  We illustrate this additional difficulty by presenting an mDSA-with-outputs that can succinctly encode an $N$-bit counter.

\subsubsection*{$N$-bit counter.} We wish to implement addition of an $N$-bit counter using an mDSA-with-outputs that has $3$ states $\{q^{init}, q_0, f\}$, $N+1$ ports and $\mathcal{O}(N)$ transitions. Suppose $b_{N-1} b_{N-2} \dots b_1 b_0$ are the $N$ bits, with $b_{N-1}$ the most significant bit and $b_0$ the least significant bit. Addition can be implemented using $N$ rules: for $j \in \{0, \dots, N-1\}$
\begin{itemize}
\item if $b_j = 0$ and $b_{j-1} = b_{j-2} = \cdots = b_0 = 1$, then change $b_j:= 1$ and $b_{j-1} = b_{j-2} = \cdots = b_0 := 0$
\end{itemize}
Starting from $0$ for all bits, there will be exactly one rule that will be applicable each time. Applying the relevant rule each time will lead to $b_{N-1} = b_{N-2} = \cdots = b_0 = 1$ in $2^N - 1$ steps.

To model this counter using an mDSA-with-outputs, we can use $N$ ports $b_{N-1}, b_{N-2}, \dots, b_0$ each having two values $\{0, 1\}$. From the initial state $q^{init}$, we can first read a dummy letter (in a fresh port), write $0$ to all ports $b_{N-1}, \dots, b_0$, and move to state $q_0$. From $q_{0}$ to $q_{0}$, there is a transition for each $j \in \{0, \dots, N-1\}$ in the following form: 
\begin{align*}
q_0 \quad \xra[~~b_j:1 ~\parallel~ b_{j-1}:0 ~\parallel~ \cdots ~\parallel~ b_0: 0~~]{ b_j:0 ~\parallel~ b_{j-1}:1 ~\parallel~ \cdots ~\parallel~ b_0: 1} \quad q_0
\end{align*}
These transitions start a sequence of $2^N -1$ $\epsilon$ transitions which finally result in all ports $b_{N-1}$ to $b_0$ being $1$. To mark the end of the computation, we add an extra transition from $q_0$ that checks if $b_{N-1}:1 \parallel b_{N-1}:1 \parallel \cdots \parallel b_0:1$ and moves to $f$. Notice that the length of the tape when the automaton reaches $f$ is exponential in the size of the input automaton. Therefore, the witness for reachability is exponential. We have crucially used the ability to have ports that can be used both as inputs and outputs. We will now pin down the complexity of the reachability problem in mDSA-with-outputs. 

\subsection{Complexity of state reachability}

We now look at the state reachability problem: given an mDSA-with-outputs $\Bb$ and a state $q$, does there exist a word that reaches $q$? Without outputs, this problem is simply a graph reachability problem, like in a DFA or a DSA. The presence of outputs makes this problem harder, as seen in the $N$-bit counter.
